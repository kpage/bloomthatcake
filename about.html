	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm YS Sim and welcome to my food blog. Each week I try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post feel free to like, subscribe, and leave a comment on my YouTube video.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Korea and learned how to decorate cakes with buttercream flowers in Seoul. I started baking full time and selling baked goods at local markets. Now I work full-time at a bakery in San Francisco.</p>
