	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to my cake decoration blog! Each week I try out a new buttercream flower cake design and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the designs I post feel free to like, subscribe, and leave a comment on my YouTube video.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Korea and learned how to decorate cakes with buttercream flowers in Seoul. I started baking full time and selling baked goods at local markets. Now I sell my creations in the San Francisco Bay Area and create tutorials on YouTube.</p>
